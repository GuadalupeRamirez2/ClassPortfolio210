            <p>My name is Guadalupe Ramirez, I am twenty-two years old and I'm from the Bronx NY. My Major is Multimedia Programming and Design. I love to procrastinate, but I'm ready to put that aside and complete all my assignments on time.</p>
            <P> Some of my hobbies are playing video games, drawing, and listen to music. When it comes to video games, I mostly play Fortnite with my friends. Sometimes I draw cartoons like Dragon Ball Z characters or Looney Tunes, but I mainly do graffiti. Some of my favorite artist that I listen to alot are: Lil Baby, Drake, Lil Wayne, Eminem, Lana Del Rey, The Weeknd, Kevin Gates and Kodak Black.</P>
            <p>I also love Sneakers and I enjoy learning about the history that's behind each silhouette. My favorite sneaker is the Air Jordan 1. I like most colorways but my favorite ones are the classic colorways.</p>
            <p>I was working in a bakery called "Sarabeth's Bakery, but due to COVID 19 I'm still unemployed. Hopefully the owner opens back soon and I get my job back. Otherwise I would be searching for a new job.</p>
